# ProDev Backend Engineering Program

This repository documents my journey and learnings from the **ProDev Backend Engineering Program**.  
The program focused on building strong backend development skills, exploring modern technologies, and applying best practices through hands-on projects.

---

## üìö Overview

The program provided practical training on:

- Core backend development concepts
- Modern frameworks and tools
- Software engineering best practices
- Real-world project implementation

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Technologies Covered

- **Python** ‚Äì foundational backend programming language
- **Django** ‚Äì full-featured web framework
- **REST APIs** ‚Äì designing and building robust APIs
- **GraphQL** ‚Äì flexible and efficient API querying
- **Docker** ‚Äì containerization and environment consistency
- **CI/CD** ‚Äì continuous integration and deployment pipelines

---

## üí° Important Backend Development Concepts

1. **Database Design**

   - Modeling entities and relationships
   - Using migrations for schema evolution

2. **Asynchronous Programming**

   - Handling background tasks with Celery
   - Improving performance with async views

3. **Caching Strategies**
   - Redis for in-memory caching
   - Query optimization and response speed-up

---

## üöß Challenges Faced & Solutions

- **Challenge:** Managing complex database relationships  
  **Solution:** Applied normalization techniques and careful use of `ForeignKey` and `ManyToMany` fields

- **Challenge:** Debugging async tasks and workers  
  **Solution:** Used structured logging and monitoring tools to trace task execution

- **Challenge:** Containerizing development and production environments  
  **Solution:** Standardized Docker configurations with `docker-compose` for local development and deployment

## ‚úÖ Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code
- Always design APIs with scalability and maintainability in mind
- Use automated tests to ensure code reliability
- Treat logs and monitoring as essential, not optional
- Continuous learning is key: backend engineering is constantly evolving

---

## üìå Next Steps
